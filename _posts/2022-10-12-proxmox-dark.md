# Proxmox Dark Mode

After installing the Proxmox hypervisor on the Dell PowerEdge R720dx that I bought for my homelab, I looked for a way to minimize the blinding brightness of the default screens in web interface. I found the following [Github](https://github.com/Weilbyte/PVEDiscordDark) site that provides a utility to swap the dark / light themes.
