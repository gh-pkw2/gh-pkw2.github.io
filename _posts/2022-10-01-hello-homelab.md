# Welcome
This site will document the configuration of the servers / software that I'm using in my home lab environment.

I'm currently using the Jekyll static site generator as recommended by TechnoTim on Youtube.

To start the local server to view changes to the posts on your development machine, use the following command at the bash prompt:
~~~console
bundle exec jekyll s
~~~
