# iBrave Hosting

In addition to the services that are hosted in my home lab, I use iBrave Unlimited hosting to host [https://keithwechsler.com](https://keithwechsler.com). The service provides normal web host functionality - hosting, e-mail, ftp, and MySQL databases.  There are also 87 One-Click Installs of various open-source web applications.

It is currently running a WordPress blog with random information.

To access the control panel, use the following URL:

- [https://cp.ibrave.io/login?r=%2F](https://cp.ibrave.io/login?r=%2F)

I've also created a domain entry for search4you.name, but I've not added any files.
